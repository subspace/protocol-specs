## Genesis Configuration

This section details the genesis configuration process for the Subspace network, establishing the foundational state of the blockchain with critical operational and network-specific parameters.

## Network Setup

### WASM Setup

Incorporates the compiled runtime logic into the genesis block, defining all operational rules and behaviors of the network.

```rust
let wasm_binary = WASM_BINARY.ok_or_else(|| "Wasm binary must be built for Gemini".to_string())?;
```

### Chain Type
Specifies the type of network, highlighting its use in a development or mainnet environment.


## Subspace Genesis Config

### sudo_account and council_members
Specifies the account with administrative privileges, enabling essential governance functionalities.

```rust
let sudo_account = AccountId::from_ss58check("5CK2tVhvWUBnbRGsPBgQ31QDEgcEFgT7KU7FT22YLcp5A1jC").expect("Wrong root account address");
let council_members = [
    "5EhEcKAfGXzEkEqYdN9Ntc4f2KJrVvabWTUceCVtDPTYxVit",
    "5G9GUNK2Vp1jgpENPmcy9TLoprkmHBTSg9bgvMa8er5ZLYjb",
    "5CAtkaN1tDiaiuaYbxeDNNnix2WhAQxu5RobMFaiaStiCcTx",
    "5CJ8ezmRwcNJmutA92ZmRpaL8e6BCPSdfnt3e6kZZWLAVUZK",
    "5CiFrTxvxmehJ7okLdEc8z3cxvWfrMpShPJy9GKymRqEgF7T",
]
```



## Genesis Params

### initial_balance

Sets up initial token distributions to facilitate early operations and ensure liquidity from the start.

### enable_rewards_at
Controls the activation of network rewards, set manually in this configuration.

```rust
enable_rewards_at: EnableRewardsAt::Manually,
```

### allow_authoring_by

Allows any eligible participant to produce blocks, promoting a decentralized and inclusive network environment.

```rust
allow_authoring_by: AllowAuthoringBy::Anyone,
```

### pot_slot_iterations

This parameter sets the number of iterations for the Proof-of-Time (PoT) function required per time slot. It balances the computational difficulty with accessibility, ensuring that the proof workload remains feasible yet secure against rapid advances in hardware capabilities.

```rust
pot_slot_iterations: NonZeroU32::new(100_000_000).expect("Not zero; qed"),
```
<Collapsible title="Implementation Note">
This line ensures that `pot_slot_iterations`, which controls the computational intensity required for each slot, is assigned a valid non-zero value. By using `NonZeroU32`, the code explicitly states that zero is not a permissible value, avoiding any logical errors where a zero could imply no computation. The `expect("Not zero; qed")` part acts as a safeguard, providing a clear runtime error message if zero is mistakenly used.
</Collapsible>

### enable_domains

Activates domain-specific features within the network.


```rust
enable_domains: true,
```

### enable_dynamic_cost_of_storage

Keeps the cost of storage static by setting this parameter to false.

```rust
enable_dynamic_cost_of_storage: false,
```

### enable_balance_transfers and enable_non_root_calls

Enables balance transfers between accounts and allows non-administrative actions within the network.

```rust
enable_balance_transfers: true,
enable_non_root_calls: true,
```

### confirmation_depth_k

This parameter specifies the minimal depth a block must reach in the blockchain before it is considered part of the recorded history. It sets a global constant for the network, distinguishing it from client-specific transaction confirmation depths. This ensures that once a block has been built upon by a certain number of subsequent blocks, it is accepted as irreversible.

### rewards_config

Details how network rewards are structured to incentivize participation and maintain network security.

```rust
rewards_config: RewardsConfig {
    remaining_issuance:
    proposer_subsidy_points:,
    voter_subsidy_points:,
},
```


## Genesis Domain Params

Describes configurations specific to domains within the network, including runtime parameters and permissions.

### genesis_domains
Configures specific domains with tailored runtime settings, permissions, and operational rules.

```rust
struct GenesisDomainParams {
    permissioned_action_allowed_by: PermissionedActionAllowedBy<AccountId>,
    genesis_domains: Vec<GenesisDomain>,
}
```
